lua_xrun
========

Easy to use mechanism to debug Lua on remote devices - requires ssh on remote device, and local installation of ZeroBraneStudio.

Lua sourcecode is kept on your developer machine: Windows, Linux or Mac is just fine.
Sourcecode ist synced with the remote device  when you start debugging your application ( Key F6 ).
Make sure "Debugging Server" is being startet in your ZBS. And Firewall is off :-)
